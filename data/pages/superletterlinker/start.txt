Try this brain-busting word game, where you click the letter wafers to spell a variety of words in all directions. Super Letter Linker requires lightning-fast mental reflexes to find all the words before time is up. Form words in all directions to launch to the next level, or try the find-all mode where you must find every word on the board to move on.
